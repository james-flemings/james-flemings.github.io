Hello! I am a fourth-year CS PhD student at the University of Southern California working in the [USC Meta research center](https://realai.usc.edu/), advised by Murali Annavaram in the [SCIP](https://scip-lab.usc.edu/) (Super Computing In Pocket) lab. I'm graciously funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org/). My research broadly investigates privacy in language models. In particular, I'm interested in (1) principally understanding and measuring privacy leakage of language models (memorization, inference-time auditing); (2) controlling privacy leakage of language models (differential privacy, post-training alignment); (3) improving information-sharing reasoning of LLMs.

I received my BS in computer science and mathematics at the University of Alaska Anchorage in 2022. While there, I pursued research in a wide range of areas, including monochromatic colorings, charged coupled devices, federated learning, and out of distribution data performance in language models.
